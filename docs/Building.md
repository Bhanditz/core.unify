Building core.unify
=====================

1. Clone the [core.unify git repository](http://github.com/clojure/core.unify) or download its [source archive](https://github.com/clojure/core.unify/zipball/master)

2. Run `mvn package` to generate a Jar file

3. Run `mvn install` to install the Jar into your local Maven repository

To test that the build succeeded try:

    mvn clojure:repl

This will launch a Clojure REPL.  Try the following to exercise core.unify:

```clojure
