core.unify v0.5.2 Release Notes
===============================

core.unify is a Clojure contrib library providing the following features:

* Factory functions for constructing unification binding, subst, and unification functions, with or without occurs checking

* Packaged functions for unification binding, subst, and unification functions, with or without occurs checking, recognizing variables tagged as symbols prefixed with `?` characters

core.unify is based on a library named Unifycle, found at http://github.com/fogus/unifycle that has been deprecated.

Plans
-----

The following capabilities are under design, development, or consideration for future versions of core.unify:

* High-performant unification based on unrolling recursive backtracking into polymorphic calls
* Iterative unification option

* More documentation

More planning is needed around capabilities not listed nor thought of.
